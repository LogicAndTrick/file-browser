# File Respository

This is an archive of various files that I've collected
over the years. Most of it is stuff I've never looked at
so I can't guarantee anything works or is even useful
to have here. But here it is anyway.

If you want your own file here, too bad, you can't. If
you have sources for other things that you think should
be archived, let me know. If you don't know how to
contact me, then you probably shouldn't.
